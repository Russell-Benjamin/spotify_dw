Spotify generates a 'Discover Weekly' playlist with new songs for users to listen to that expires after each week. This is a Python script making use of the Spotify API, spotipy library, and Selenium to automate saving these songs to a new playlist "Saved Discover Weekly" to archive suggested music (~30 songs) before they leave Discover Weekly.
